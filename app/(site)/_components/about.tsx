      I&apos;m a Full Stack developer with a real love for crafting digital experiences. Professionally, I&apos;ve been immersed in web and mobile development since 2021, diving deep into technologies like Typescript, React.js, Next.js, React Native, and Node.js. While I excel in these stacks, I&apos;m also open and adaptable to exploring other languages and technologies.
